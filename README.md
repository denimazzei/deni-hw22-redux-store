# deni-hw22-redux-store

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to refactor the e-commerce platform from Activity 26 so that it uses Redux. Sweeping changes to the code aren't necessary, but reading through Redux documentation on your own to find the information you need. Some guidelines have been provided in the Getting Started section to point you in the right direction. If you haven't yet, download the e-commerce platform code from Activity 26.
